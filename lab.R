#' This lab works differently from the previous ones.  In this lab, you'll be working in pairs on a two-part assignment.  In the first part, you'll do a brief exploratory data analysis of the dataset used in Silberzahn, et al. (2018), “Many Analysts, One Data Set” (*Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science*, <https://doi.org/10.1177/2515245917747646>).  In the second part, you and your partner will do a code review for another pair's EDA.

#' Instructions for Part 1
#' -----------------------
#' 
#' **Due Friday, October 15**
#' 
#' Start by taking a look at the introduction and methods section for Silberzahn et al.  We're less interested in the analysis they did, and more interested in the documentation for the dataset.  You can download the dataset itself here: <https://osf.io/fv8c3/>. You'll also want to download the accompanying `README.txt`, which contains a brief data dictionary, although you need to change the extension from `txt` to `rtf`. 
#' 
#' Working with your partner, spend about 1.5-2 hours on an EDA of this dataset.  For your primary research question, you can use the one from Silberzahn et al.: Are dark-skinned football (soccer) players more likely to be red-carded?  Or you can make up your own question.  Use the checklists from the EDA part of the course to structure your analysis. 
#' 
#' I recommend organizing your workflow with your partner as follows.  Work together in a single GitHub repository.  (The owner of the repository should give the other partner permission to push to the repository, otherwise you'll have to deal with a lot of pull requests).  Work together over Zoom (or Discord or Hangouts or whatever) using screensharing.  Set a timer for 15 or 20 minutes, and alternate which partner is "driving" when the timer goes off. 
#' 
#' Developing an answer to your primary question is less important than three other goals:  (1) practicing EDA, (2) practicing writing good, readable, reproducible code, and (3) generating code for the code review in part 2. So don't worry if things are "incomplete." 
#' 
#' To submit your code, file a pull request against the class version of this repository in the usual way. 
#' 


#' Instructions for Part 2
#' -----------------------
#' 
#' **Due Tuesday, October 19**
#' 
#' I will assign you and your partner another group's code to review, with a link to the pull request.  Plan to spend about 2 hours on this review.  
#' 
#' On the pull request, go to the Files tab to view the files that have been added/modified by the other group.
